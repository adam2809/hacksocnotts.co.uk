Morgan. Quorum is ideal for any application requiring high speed and high throughput processing of private transactions within a permissioned group of known participants. Quorum addresses specific challenges to blockchain technology adoption within the financial industry and beyond.\n\n## TechMarketplace Decentralized App\nBy interacting with the codebase of a fully-functional decentralized application, you will learn the structure of a dApp and how to write functions in Solidity, the Contract-Oriented language.
