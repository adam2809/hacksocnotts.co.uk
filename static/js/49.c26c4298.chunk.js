Just turn up - it's free!\n\n## Lightning Talks: The Audience Takes Over!\nThis is the event where you take control - we'll be running lightning talks and anyone can speak!\n\n###What Is A Lightning Talk?\nA lightning talk is a short talk, under five minutes on whatever subject you wish to speak about (Code of Conduct permitting!). At the start of the session the audience has time to come up, write their talk title on a post-it and stick it to the board and those talks make up our evening. If there are too many talks to fit in to the evening, we'll vote on our favourites.\n\n**For the audience** it's a rapid-fire session where you'll learn loads and gain unique insight into the thoughts, ideas and passions of your peers.\n\n**For speakers** it's a unique opportunity to speak your mind, try out a talk idea and boost your confidence in front of a friendly crowd. Since the talks are short, the pressure to prep and polish is low and you can focus on key ideas you want to share.\n\n###Great Lightning Talks We've Seen\nElmer McCurdy, who died in 1911 but wasn't buried until 1977\n\nHow an innocent pie inadvertently broke an infrastructure project\n\nBecoming a better developer with porridge\n\nFor inspiration, you can see some examples in [this blog post](https://www.technottingham.com/news/2017/10/13/tech-nottingham-was-struck-by-lightning-and-it-was-awesome) about a previous Lightning Talks session at Tech Nottingham.\n\n###Slides?\nYou may prepare a few slides but it's totally optional; they must be in Powerpoint, Google Slides or Keynote format and be shared on the #lightning-talks channel on the Tech Nottingham Slack group before the talks start (we'll be running them all from the same laptop so we don't waste time doing battle with the TV), or you're most welcome to send them to us privately.\n\n"}});
