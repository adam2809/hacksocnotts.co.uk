This includes (but is not limited to) someone's gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, class, dis/ability, physical appearanceo or body size. (Please talk to us to make this description better!)\\n\\n**As an attendee, what can I expect?**\\n\\nmargins is a small, intimate conference for about 100 people. It will be a day filled with workshops and talks that are centred around technology, inspiration and solidarity. The conference is split into two tracks that run at the same time: One for workshops and one for talks. In between, around and outside these tracks, the space offers a chance to chat, network and meet new people on the day. Lunch and snacks will be provided for free. While the schedule is not finalised, margins will run from around 10am until 4pm-ish.\\n\\n**Do I have to identify as “marginalised” to attend?**\\n\\nThe conference is open to everybody. If you're not from a marginalised background, if the term “marginalised” doesn't sit right with you, if you're not sure if you belong: Please come around! We would love to see on the day.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/_events/margins-2019/description.md\n// module id = 1286\n// module chunks = 79"],"sourceRoot":""}
