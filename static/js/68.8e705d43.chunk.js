I competed at the National Computer Science competitions in Greece, placed 18th, where I used C++ to solve problems with algorithms and data structures. I find C++ to be one of the most well structured languages out there and as such I'd be glad to guide you through it. \n\n<img src=\"/event_imgs/panagiotis.jpg\" alt=\"Panagiotis\" height=\"250px\">\n\n### What's this worshop all about?\n\nIn this workshop we will go over the basics of C++ as well as some good practices on how to write good code with it. Although prior programming experience isn't required for this workshop, if you know a language like C, Java or Javascript it should make things a bit easier for you.\n\n__Workshop 1__\n\nIn the first workshop we will go over the basic code structures of C++. Although they might seem intimidating at first they really are very simple. We will be talking about:\n\n - variable declerations and types\n - For loops\n - If statements\n - switches\n - functions\n - namespaces\n - how to include libraries\n\n__Workshop 2__\n\nIn the second worshop it's all about containers. Containers are the building blocks of any C++ program and as such they are very important. More specifically we will go over the following:\n\n - array\n - list\n - vector\n - queue\n - stack\n - map/unordered_map\n - set/unordered_set\n - how to build your own containers\n\n__Workshop 3__\n\nHaving down the fundementals of C++ and containers it's time to put that knowledge to good use. And to do that we introduce the STL algorithms as well as go over the patterns that you need to know to build your own. Some of the algorithms we will go through include:\n\n - sort\n - find/binary_find\n - erase\n - remove_if\n - for_each\n - min/max\n - lambda expressions\n - how to write your own algorithms for containers\n\n### What's next?\n\nEven though we cover a lot of material throught this workshop, the only way to get good at something is by practicing. And thus at the end you will be encouraged to build your own C++ programs and experiment with the language. I hope to see you at the workshop!\n"}});
