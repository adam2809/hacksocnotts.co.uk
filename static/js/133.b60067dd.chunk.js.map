XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it. In this workshop, the students will learn how to detect and prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\\n\\n \\nAll the workshops provided with a copy of [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project) to practice and learn more about web application security.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/_events/2019-cyber-security-xss/description.md\n// module id = 1178\n// module chunks = 133"],"sourceRoot":""}
