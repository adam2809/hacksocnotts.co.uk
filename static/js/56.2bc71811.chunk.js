Welcome to the successful YASC Ltd. I'm sure you've heard of us. What you might not know is that we're losing market share and our costs are rising. You did sign the NDA, right? Well, we need your help. We know that something needs to change but we're not sure where to start. We've heard that DevOps might be the answer. We definitely have silos in our company that don't work well with each other and we have a lot of manual steps that we want to automate.\"\n\nThis session will evaluate YASC's current position and the audience will decide what they do to improve the company's situation. Choose wisely and you will lead the company to be stronger than ever; choose poorly and you might just be responsible for record losses and widespread redundancies.\n\n### About Louise\n![Headshot of speaker Louise Paling](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53428a5fe4b0fa0c16894821/1558385431243-UP7YYFCJAWNQVIXWA2B6/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLxnK526YWAH1qleWz-y7AFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVH33scGBZjC30S7EYewNF5iKKwhonf2ThqWWOBkLKnojuqYeU1KwPvsAK7Tx5ND4WE/LouisePaling.jpg?format=300w)\n\nLouise has worked in software delivery for 20 years, from her roots as a software engineer to management of both delivery teams and operations teams. She is experienced in introducing new ways of working to teams and in merging the seemingly disparate worlds of Agile and traditional project management.\n\nLouise has been involved in transforming software development capability from a waterfall-focused process to an Agile development method and most recently towards a DevOps model.\n\n### About Liam\n![Headshot of speaker Liam Gulliver](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53428a5fe4b0fa0c16894821/1558385451992-V6HSLIBS78XHE3T1HVAO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLxnK526YWAH1qleWz-y7AFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVH33scGBZjC30S7EYewNF5iKKwhonf2ThqWWOBkLKnojuqYeU1KwPvsAK7Tx5ND4WE/LiamGulliver.jpg?format=300w)\n\nLiam is the Chief Executive of Element 94, which has been built by experts to help coach and guide a wide variety of businesses in software development and DevOps, providing consultancy solutions to transform and accelerate the way that organisations deliver software.

Is it clear, concise and self-explanatory? Is it maintainable? Is it easy to get up and running? Do your colleagues understand it? Will your future self understand it after another six months of working on five other projects? Will a future stranger understand it in two years after the entire team have rotated and nobody is left who\u2019s ever worked on it?\n\nWe\u2019ll take a trip through some code and situations inspired by actual events and consider how we can ensure our code is fit for our colleagues and our future selves.\n\n### About Matthew\n\nMatthew Walton graduated from the University of Nottingham in 2003, swore never to get a job working with networks and promptly ended up writing some very high-performance network routing and analysis software for his first two jobs. After some diversions in desktop, web and consultancy work Matthew is now a Senior Developer at Commify, where he works on the core messaging platform and APIs."}});
