webpackJsonp([79],{1286:function(e,n){e.exports="**About margins**\n\n[margins](https://margins.tech) is a free one-day conference for people from marginalised backgrounds that work in/with/around technology (or hope to break into the industry!).\n\nEveryone is welcome to join us in Nottingham for a day filled with inspiration, solidarity and compassion.\n\nRegister for margins at https://tickets.margins.tech/\n\n**What does \u201cbeing marginalised\u201d mean?**\n\nThat\u2019s a really good question! \u201cBeing from a marginalised background\u201d means that someone is part of a group that is being dismissed as \u201cinsignificant\u201d or treated unfairly as \u201coutside the norm\u201d in society. This includes (but is not limited to) someone's gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, class, dis/ability, physical appearanceo or body size. (Please talk to us to make this description better!)\n\n**As an attendee, what can I expect?**\n\nmargins is a small, intimate conference for about 100 people. It will be a day filled with workshops and talks that are centred around technology, inspiration and solidarity. The conference is split into two tracks that run at the same time: One for workshops and one for talks. In between, around and outside these tracks, the space offers a chance to chat, network and meet new people on the day. Lunch and snacks will be provided for free. While the schedule is not finalised, margins will run from around 10am until 4pm-ish.\n\n**Do I have to identify as \u201cmarginalised\u201d to attend?**\n\nThe conference is open to everybody. If you're not from a marginalised background, if the term \u201cmarginalised\u201d doesn't sit right with you, if you're not sure if you belong: Please come around! We would love to see on the day."}});
